This is the archive of (most) Fortnite Gameservers! All credits go to their respective owners/developers


# Missing Gameservers
As of now we are missing a Gameserver that I do not have as of now<br>
We are missing:<br>
- Area35<br>
- Fortnite_Server (with SDK)

# Contribution
If you would like to add new/missing/old Gameservers you can do in 2 ways<br>
- DM me on Discord (Enderman#1337) with the .zip file of the Gameserver (if SDK, provide SDK aswell, if non SDK just send source)<br>
- Fork the repo and add the gameserver into a folder with it's name on. Then send Pull Request
